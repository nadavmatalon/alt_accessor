<h2>AltAccessor Module</h2> 

<h3>#alt_accessor</h3>

<p>The AltAccessor module contains a single method: alt_accessor</p>

<p>This method seeks to offer a ruby-based alternative with the same functionality as the original attr_accessor method.</p>

<p>The new method was created according to the TDD methodology using Rspec for testing (Rspec tests file included in the repo).</p>
